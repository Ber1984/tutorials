/*
A bounded buffer is a fixed-size data structure that is used to store a limited number of items. It is commonly used in scenarios like the Producer-Consumer problem, where producers add items to the buffer and consumers remove items from it.

âœ… Characteristics of a Bounded Buffer:
Fixed Capacity: The size of the buffer is predefined and cannot grow dynamically.

Blocking Behavior: If the buffer is full, producers must wait until space becomes available. If the buffer is empty, consumers must wait until an item is available.

Thread Safety: Access to the buffer is synchronized to prevent data corruption due to concurrent access
