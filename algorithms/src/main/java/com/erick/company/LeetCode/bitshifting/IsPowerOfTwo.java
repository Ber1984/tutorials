    Yes, this is a common and very efficient way to determine if a number is a power of two using bit manipulation. Let's break it down step-by-step.

‚úÖ Understanding the Bit Manipulation Approach:
The Key Expression:

return ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
This expression leverages a unique property of powers of two in binary representation.

‚úÖ Binary Representation of Powers of Two:
Powers of two have a unique pattern in binary:

2
0
=
1
2
0
 =1: 0001

2
1
=
2
2
1
 =2: 0010

2
2
=
4
2
2
 =4: 0100

2
3
=
8
2
3
 =8: 1000

2
4
=
16
2
4
 =16: 10000

Notice that each power of two has exactly one bit set to 1, and all the other bits are 0.

‚úÖ Binary Representation of
ùëõ
‚àí
1
n‚àí1:
Now, let's look at how subtracting 1 affects the binary representation of a power of two:

1 (0001) - 1 = 0 (0000)

2 (0010) - 1 = 1 (0001)

4 (0100) - 1 = 3 (0011)

8 (1000) - 1 = 7 (0111)

16 (10000) - 1 = 15 (01111)

Notice that the binary representation of n - 1 flips all the bits after the least significant 1 bit, converting it to 0 and turning all previous 0s to 1s.

‚úÖ Applying the Bitwise & Operator:
Now, let's see what happens when we perform the bitwise AND operation between n and n - 1:

n = 8 ‚Üí 1000

n - 1 = 7 ‚Üí 0111

   1000
&  0111
--------
   0000

Result is 0, which means 8 is a power of two.

If n is not a power of two, then the binary representation of n will have more than one 1 bit, and the bitwise AND operation will not result in 0.

‚úÖ Example: Not a Power of Two
For n = 10:

n = 10 ‚Üí 1010

n - 1 = 9 ‚Üí 1001

markdown
Copy
Edit
   1010
&  1001
--------
   1000 (not zero)
Since the result is not zero, 10 is not a power of two.

‚úÖ Why n <= 0 Check?
Negative numbers are not powers of two.

Zero is not a power of two.

Thus, the if (n <= 0) condition handles these cases upfront.

‚úÖ Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(1), as bitwise operations are constant-time operations.

Space Complexity: O(1), no extra space is used.

The binary representation of -2147483648 is:
10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

Here, the most significant bit (the leftmost 1) represents the sign bit, indicating that the number is negative. Thus, Integer.bitCount(-2147483648) is 1, but it is not a power of two.
         */

        /*
        Handling Negative Numbers:
A power of two is always positive. Therefore, before applying the bitCount() check, we need to ensure that the input is positive. We can do that by adding an early return condition:

         Why This Works:
The Integer.bitCount(n) method counts the number of 1 bits in the binary representation.

A power of two has exactly one set bit in its binary representation.

2^0 = 1 ‚Üí 00000001 (1 set bit)

2^1 = 2 ‚Üí 00000010 (1 set bit)

2^2 = 4 ‚Üí 00000100 (1 set bit)
