Advantages of Balanced Binary Tree:
Balanced binary trees, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, maintain their height in logarithmic proportion to the number of nodes. This ensures that fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, and search are executed with O(log n) time complexity.
Non Destructive In a balanced binary tree are performed in such a way that the tree remains balanced without requiring a complete reorganization.
Balanced binary trees are well-suited for range queries, where you need to find all elements within a specified range.

/*
Each node in a Red-Black Tree follows these five key properties:

Each node is either red or black.

The root is always black.

All leaves (nulls or "NIL nodes") are black.

Red nodes cannot have red children (no two reds in a row).

Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes (called black-height).

These properties keep the tree roughly balanced, meaning the longest path from root to leaf is at most twice the shortest path. This guarantees performance.
