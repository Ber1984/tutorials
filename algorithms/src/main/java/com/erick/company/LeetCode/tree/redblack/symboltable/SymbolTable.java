/*
Symbol Tables in Compilers
A symbol table is a data structure used by a compiler to store information about identifiers (like variables, methods, classes). It maps names to:

Their scope and type (int, string, etc.)

Memory locations

Other metadata (e.g., is it a constant?)

Real-world analogy:

The compiler adds x to the symbol table, marks its type as int, and assigns it a memory address. Symbol tables are often implemented using balanced trees or hash tables.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count; //
        String name = "Erick";
