The .class file is a binary representation of Java bytecode, structured in a strict format.

It consists of a magic number, version, constant pool, access flags, class references, interfaces, fields, methods, and attributes.

Bytecode instructions are low-level, stack-based operations that the JVM interprets or compiles to native code.
